# Route Synchronization System - Complete Documentation

**Status: ✅ Production Ready**
**Version: 1.0**
**Last Updated: November 29, 2024**

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

A complete, production-grade system that automatically detects when developers add or remove routes from route files, syncs them to a database, and enforces role-based access control.

**In Plain English:** If you add a new route to `routes/managers.php`, it automatically appears in the database within 3-15 seconds (configurable). No manual intervention needed.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Create database tables
php artisan migrate

# 2. Sync existing routes
php artisan routes:sync

# 3. Start watching for changes
php artisan routes:watch

# 4. (Optional) Set up supervisor for production
sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh prod
```

**That's it!** The system is now running.

For detailed instructions, see **`QUICK_START.md`**

## 🚀 How It Works

### Simple Overview

```
Developer adds route to file
        ↓
File Monitor detects change (every 3-15 seconds)
        ↓
Sync Service extracts routes
        ↓
Routes are added to database
        ↓
Middleware enforces permissions
        ↓
Users can access route (if authorized)
```

### Detailed Flow

1. **Developer adds a route:**
   ```php
   // routes/managers.php
   Route::resource('reports', ReportController::class);
   ```

2. **File watcher detects change** (within 3-15 seconds):
   - Calculates file hash
   - Compares with previous hash
   - Detects it's different

3. **Sync service extracts routes:**
   - Reads Laravel router
   - Gets route metadata
   - Generates unique hash

4. **Database is updated:**
   - New routes inserted
   - Changed routes updated
   - Deleted routes removed

5. **Permissions enforced:**
   - Middleware checks user role
   - Verifies permissions
   - Allows/denies access

---

## 🛠️ Core Commands

### Manual Sync
```bash
# One-time synchronization of all routes
php artisan routes:sync
```

### Interactive Watch
```bash
# Watch for changes in real-time (development)
php artisan routes:watch --interval=5
```

### Background Daemon
```bash
# Run as background daemon
php artisan routes:daemon --interval=3

# Check if running
php artisan routes:daemon --status

# Stop daemon
php artisan routes:daemon --stop
```

### Supervisor Setup
```bash
# Automated setup for development
sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh dev

# Automated setup for production
sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh prod

# Both environments
sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh both
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Synced

The system tracks:
- ✅ Route name (e.g., 'users.index')
- ✅ Route path (e.g., '/users')
- ✅ HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- ✅ Controller and action
- ✅ Required middleware
- ✅ Authentication requirement
- ✅ User profile/role
- ✅ Unique hash for deduplication

Routes that are **skipped**:
- ❌ Routes without names (unnamed routes)
- ❌ Laravel debug routes (debugbar, ignition)
- ❌ API routes (by design)
- ❌ Middleware-only routes (no controller)

---

## 🔐 Access Control

Three approaches to protect routes:

### 1️⃣ Middleware-Based (RECOMMENDED)
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'check.roles.permissions:manager'])
    ->group(function () {
        Route::resource('users', UserController::class);
    });
```

**Pros:** Centralized, single point of control
**Use:** Most route groups

### 2️⃣ Separate Routing
```php
// Separate files per role
routes/manager-users.php
routes/admin-users.php
```

**Pros:** Clear separation by role
**Use:** Significantly different logic per role

### 3️⃣ Permission-Based
```php
Route::resource('users', UserController::class)
    ->middleware('check.permissions:users.view');
```

**Pros:** Fine-grained control
**Use:** Complex permission requirements

## 📋 Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: Manual (for testing)
```bash
php artisan routes:sync
```
One-time sync, useful for testing.

### Mode 2: Interactive (for development)
```bash
php artisan routes:watch
```
Real-time monitoring with terminal output.

### Mode 3: Daemon (for continuous operation)
```bash
php artisan routes:daemon --interval=3
```
Background process, logs to file.

### Mode 4: Supervisor (for production)
```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh prod
```
Managed by Supervisor, auto-restart, persistent.

## 📊 Database Schema

### app_routes Table
Stores route information:
- Route name, path, methods
- Controller and action
- Profile/role
- Required middleware
- Authentication status
- Unique hash

### route_permissions Table
Links routes to permissions:
- route_id (FK to app_routes)
- permission_id (FK to permissions)
- Enables many-to-many relationships

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Status
```bash
# Manual
php artisan tinker
>>> AppRoute::count()

# Supervisor
sudo supervisorctl status

# View logs
tail -f storage/logs/supervisor/route-watcher-prod.log
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Routes not syncing | Check daemon is running: `supervisorctl status` |
| High CPU usage | Increase check interval (15s for prod) |
| Permission denied | Run migrations: `php artisan migrate` |
| Supervisor won't start | Rerun setup: `sudo ./scripts/setup-supervisor.sh prod` |
