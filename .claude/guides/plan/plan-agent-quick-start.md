# Plan Agent - Quick Start Guide (5 min)

**Get started with Plan Agent in 5 minutes.**

---

## What is Plan Agent?

The **Plan Agent** helps you design implementation strategies BEFORE you write code. It breaks down complex features into manageable tasks and creates clear development roadmaps.

---

## When to Use Plan Agent?

✅ **Starting a new feature**
✅ **Breaking down complex tasks**
✅ **Designing database schema**
✅ **Planning API structure**
✅ **Identifying risks**
✅ **Creating development timeline**

---

## Quick Formula (Copy & Paste)

```
Plan [feature name] with:
- [requirement 1]
- [requirement 2]
- [requirement 3]
- [specific constraint if any]
```

---

## 5 Real Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature
```
Plan a customer review system where:
- Users can submit reviews (1-5 stars)
- Reviews are displayed on product page
- Admin can delete inappropriate reviews
- Email notification to product owner
```

**Time to plan:** 5 minutes
**Output:** Task list, database schema, API endpoints

---

### Example 2: Medium Complexity
```
Plan a wishlist feature for customers:
- Users can add/remove products from wishlist
- View wishlist with product details
- Share wishlist with friends (link)
- Get notifications when wishlisted items are on sale
- Admin can see wishlist trends
```

**Time to plan:** 10 minutes
**Output:** Requirements, schema, task breakdown, risks

---

### Example 3: Complex Feature
```
Plan a returns management system:
- Customers request return (with reason)
- Warehouse validates return
- Generate return label
- Process refund
- Track return status in real-time
- Analytics for return trends
```

**Time to plan:** 15 minutes
**Output:** Complete roadmap, schema, risks, deployment plan

### Step 1: Request Plan
```
Ask: "Plan [feature] with [requirements]"
Time: Instant
```

### Step 2: Review Plan
```
Read through the output
Identify clarifications needed
Mark any disagreements
Time: 5-15 minutes
```

### Step 3: Use Plan with Frontend/Backend Agents
```
Now use Frontend Agent for UI
Now use Backend Agent for API
Follow the task breakdown from Plan
Time: Implementation time
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "Plan a dashboard"
✅ **Better:** "Plan an admin dashboard with user analytics, sales trends, and system health monitoring"

❌ **Too detailed:** "Plan each line of code"
✅ **Better:** "Plan the database schema and API structure"

❌ **Missing context:** "Plan the feature"
✅ **Better:** "Plan a feature for warehouse staff to track inventory"

---

## Pro Tips

💡 **Tip 1:** Give context about who will use the feature
```
"Plan a feature for warehouse staff to..."
"Plan an admin panel for managers to..."
"Plan an API for mobile apps to..."
```

💡 **Tip 2:** Include constraints
```
"...must work offline"
"...must support 10k concurrent users"
"...must integrate with ERP system"
```

💡 **Tip 3:** Specify integrations
```
"...integrated with our existing warehouse system"
"...must broadcast real-time updates"
"...needs email notifications"
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read** `feature-planning-guide.md` for detailed examples
2. **Read** `architecture-planning-guide.md` for schema design tips
3. **Read** `task-breakdown-guide.md` for task sequencing
4. **Read** `risk-assessment-guide.md` for risk identification

---

## TL;DR - 30 Seconds

```
1. Think of feature you want to plan
2. Write requirements (3-5 bullet points)
3. Request: "Plan [feature] with [requirements]"
4. Get back: requirements, schema, tasks, risks, timeline
5. Use that plan with Frontend & Backend Agents
```

**That's it! You're ready to plan features like a pro.** 🚀
